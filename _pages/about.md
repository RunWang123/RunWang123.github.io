Welcome to my academic website! I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at The Ohio State University, with a focus on Edge Computing and Mobile Computing. I am passionate about building efficient systems for edge devices and mobile platforms, and my research broadly spans mobile app optimization, system profiling, and energy-efficient computing.

Before joining OSU, I earned my Master’s degree from Carnegie Mellon University and my Bachelor’s degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. In both programs, I worked on research projects involving mobile security, system optimization, and AI-based engineering applications.

Research Interests
======
* Mobile and Edge Computing Systems
* Mobile App Optimization and Profiling
* Energy-Efficient System Design
* Cloud/Edge/IoT Application Architectures
* Machine Learning for Systems

Recent Highlights
======
* **[MAPP: Predictive UI View Pre-caching for Improving the Responsiveness of Mobile Apps]** 
* **Component Segmentation of Engineering Drawings Using Graph Convolutional Networks**, published in *Computers in Industry*, May 2023 (Acknowledged)

About This Site
======
This website is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), built on top of [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).  
It is hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), allowing free, automatic updates as I push new content.

The website is structured with markdown-based content files, automatically generating pages for:
- Publications
- Talks
- Teaching
- Projects
- Curriculum Vitae (CV)

This design makes it easy to maintain and extend without complex backend systems. Markdown-driven academic websites allow high flexibility, fast load times, and ease of version control using Git.

If you are interested in creating your own academic website, you can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and customize it just like I did!

More information about customizing the Academic Pages template is available [here](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/).
