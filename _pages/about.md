Welcome to my academic website! I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at The Ohio State University, with a focus on Edge Computing and Mobile Computing. I am passionate about building efficient systems for edge devices and mobile platforms, and my research broadly spans mobile app optimization, system profiling, and energy-efficient computing.

Before joining OSU, I earned my Master’s degree from Carnegie Mellon University and my Bachelor’s degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. In both programs, I worked on research projects involving computer vision, system optimization, and AI-based engineering applications.
