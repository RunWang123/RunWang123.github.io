   ```

3. **Update the visitor-map.html file:**
   - Replace `YOUR_CLUSTRMAPS_ID` with the ID from your script
   - The ID is the part after `d=` in the URL

## 📍 Adding to Your Homepage

Add this line to your `about.md` file where you want the map to appear:

```markdown
{% include visitor-map.html %}
```

## 📊 Features Included

## 🌟 Result

Once set up, you'll have:
- A beautiful world map showing visitor locations

- Professional presentation matching your site design

The map will show dots/pins on countries where visitors have accessed your site, creating an engaging visual representation of your global reach! 🌍
