This winter, I embarked on an epic cross-country road trip, driving over 2,200 miles from **Columbus, Ohio** to **Los Angeles, California**. It was an unforgettable journey through the changing landscapes of America.

### The Route

We planned our route to hit several iconic cities along the way:

1.  **Columbus, OH** 🏁
    *   Our journey began here, packing up the car and heading west on I-70.

2.  **St. Louis, MO**
    *   Our first major landmark was the Gateway Arch, standing tall over the Mississippi River.

3.  **Kansas City, MO**
    *   We stopped for some world-famous BBQ and enjoyed the vibrant atmosphere before pushing into the Great Plains.

4.  **Denver, CO**
    *   The scenery changed dramatically as we approached the Rockies. The "Mile High City" offered stunning mountain views and crisp air.

5.  **Las Vegas, NV**
    *   A dazzling stop in the Mojave Desert. The neon lights of the Strip were a surreal contrast to the miles of open road we just covered.

6.  **Los Angeles, CA** 🌴
    *   Final destination! Arriving at the Pacific Coast felt like a huge accomplishment after days of driving.

From the forests of the Midwest to the endless horizon of the plains, the towering peaks of the Rockies, and the arid beauty of the desert—this trip showed us the incredible diversity of the US landscape.
